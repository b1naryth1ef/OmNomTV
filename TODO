- Allow for torrents to be "completed" but not have a local file
- Allow for backends to handle URL's and serving content
- Added client backends for torrent downloaders (rtorrent?)
- Properly setup the scheduled downloader
- Have options for marking episodes as watched (and thus removing big green button of swag)
- Redo frontend to be more dynamic/auto-refresh/swag
- Fix percentage bars so they don't suck complete dick
